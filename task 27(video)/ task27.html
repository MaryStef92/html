        <h1>Semester</h1>
        <p> Summer holiday had begun. Mohit was excited. His father had made arrangements for a trip to Kullu and Manali during the holiday. Preparations had started a week before.
            He was told that sometimes even summer nights can be quite cold if it rains. So some woollen clothes were also packed up along with other clothes.
            They were to leave Delhi on the night of 25th May in an airconditioned bus from ISBT, New Delhi.
            Hotels were booked in advance. There was nothing spectacular on the night journey except that they had a reasonably good dinner at one of the dhabas at the GT Road.
            Things started changing as they approached Kullu. The Bias river and the surrounding forests and apple orchards presented a different but pleasant landscape.
            They found Manali and its surrounding simply breathtaking. They had looked at a beautiful five-star resort overlooking the Bias River. The rooms were very spacious, neat and clean.
            They could overlook the river and the far-flung snow-capped peaks of the Himalayas. A visit to the Vashishta Baths was really a thrilling experience.
            They visited the Hidimba Temple and the famous Vyas shrine. Many European tourists had adopted a village near the river. 
            They were in the news for the wrong reasons. Many of them were drug addicts and hard drunkards. The visit to the Salang Valley and the famous Rohtang Pass was really very exciting and an incredible experience.
            They say good things don’t last long. They had made arrangements to stay in Manali and Kullu for twenty days. But this was not to be. His uncle flashed a message that the date for counselling to his IIT 
            Admission was fixed on the next Monday. He couldn’t take a chance. He had to leave the little paradise to prepare him for the next assignment.</p>
