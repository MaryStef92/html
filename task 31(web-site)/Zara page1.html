            <p>Zara as brand offers a wide range of choices: the collections for women, men and children. The brand also launched a line of cosmetics, perfumes and household products.

                Zara’s products are supplied based on consumer trends. Its highly responsive supply chain ships new products to stores twice a week. After products are designed, they take ten to fifteen days to reach the stores.</p>
            <p> The business aspect-

                Zara as of 2017 manages up to 20 clothing collections a year.
                2. Zara is a part of the € 4 billion Inditex group and 100% owned company, based in Barcelona. Over 80% of the group’s sales are contributed by Zara’s 600 stores. Women’s, men’s and children’s wear, over 724 stores in 56 countries.
                
                3. Zara as of 2017 manages up to 20 clothing collections a year.
                
                4. Zara currently has 1,751 stores worldwide. They incur an annual revenue of over $9 Billion dollars (2009).
                
                5. Its parent company is owned 60% INDITEX by the Ortega family and Inditex has carried out in 2005 to 6.741 billion turnovers. Zara has about 2000 thousands branches around the world. Zara is a distributor of apparels.
                
                6. On the face of it, none of it really makes sense. For starters the company doesn’t advertise and still manufactures most of its products in Europe. But when you look at the heart of Ortega’s business you start to see what a true retail visionary he is. Right from the outset Zara’s business model has been built with flexibility and speed at its heart. Instrumental to the company’s success is the connection between the stores, the in-house designers, and its factories. This has always been a key factor, coupled with the company’s deft logistical management.
                
                7 .It’s these vital ingredients that enable him to interpret trends and get them from the catwalk to the high street within weeks. Before Zara came along it took five to six months. And once we’d had a taste of what is now commonly referred to as ‘fast fashion’ we just couldn’t get enough of it.
                
                8. All of the clothing is processed through the distribution center in Spain. New items are inspected, sorted, tagged, and loaded into trucks. In most cases, the clothing is delivered within 48 hours. Zara produces over 450 million items per year.
            </p>
            <p> Zara’s role in building the much needed passion for fashion has grown since its very introduction of the concept of fast fashion. In simpler terms, Zara has made the top level of fashion something that people from another market would want or aspire to own with designs that reflect the fashion trends that are currently breaking the market at the top level. This makes the buyers from a lesser buying capacity feel the desire to own bigger brands. 
                By pleasing all of its buyers in different departments, Zara not only promotes high fashion but also keeps its customers satisfied and wanting for more at the same place which is clearly seen in the way it caters to the customers with its TRF collection.
